1. Minimize the usage of global variables: While global variables may be convenient, they can introduce complexity and make the code harder to reason about. Consider encapsulating the relevant variables and functions into a struct or a higher-level interface that can be passed around to different components of the GUI application. This can help improve code modularity and testability.

2. Leverage goroutines and channels: Since you are building a GUI application, it's important to ensure that the GUI remains responsive during the replay process. You can achieve this by utilizing goroutines and channels to perform packet replay and update the GUI asynchronously. This way, the GUI can continue to handle user interactions while the packet replay is running in the background.

3. Implement progress updates: Provide progress updates to the user during the replay process. This can be done by periodically updating a progress bar or displaying the current status (e.g., number of packets processed, elapsed time) in the GUI. This will give users feedback on the progress of the replay operation and make the application more user-friendly.

4. Optimize packet processing: Look for opportunities to optimize the packet processing loop. For example, if the pcap file is large, you could consider implementing a buffered reading mechanism to reduce disk I/O operations. Additionally, profile the code to identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize them accordingly.

5. Error handling and logging: Improve the error handling and logging mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to the user and aid in troubleshooting. Consider using a structured logging library like logrus or zap to enhance the logging capabilities of the application.
